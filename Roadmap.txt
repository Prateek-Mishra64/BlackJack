2-Month Roadmap for Blackjack Game
    Week 1 – Project Setup & Core Game Logic

        Goals: Get the skeleton of the game running with rule-based AI.

        Create project folder and virtual environment (Ext_Pyt)

        Install libraries: arcade, numpy, and others you’ll need later

        Set up Neovim workflow and test Arcade installation

        Implement core Blackjack rules engine: dealing cards, player actions, hand scoring

        Make simple text-based or placeholder graphics to test mechanics

Deliverable: Playable console or placeholder GUI version of Blackjack

    Week 2 – Basic Arcade Game Loop

        Goals: Transition from text-based to graphical interface

        Set up Arcade window and main game loop

        Load placeholder card images (colored rectangles or numbers)
        
        Implement player interaction: mouse clicks or keyboard for hit/stand

        Implement dealer AI (simple rule-based)
    
Deliverable: Basic playable Blackjack with graphical window, placeholder cards

    Week 3 – Pixel Art & Card Sprites

        Goals: Start creating the visual identity

       Design pixel art cards (one full deck or minimal for testing)

       Create simple animations (card flipping, dealing)

       Export cards as PNGs and integrate into Arcade

       Test sprite rendering and animations
    
Deliverable: Visually improved game with custom card sprites and basic animations

     Week 4  User Interface & Menus

Goals: Add polish to menus and UX

    Create start screen, difficulty selection, and game over screen

    Implement buttons for actions (hit, stand, restart)

    Add score display, round info, and simple feedback messages

    Integrate sound effects (deal card, win/lose)

Deliverable: Polished UI with menus, buttons, and sound
Week 5 – Rule-Based AI Enhancement

Goals: Make the AI smarter and prepare for ML integration

    Improve dealer AI logic

    Implement basic strategy AI for medium difficulty

    Test different difficulty modes (easy = random, medium = basic strategy)

    Ensure AI decisions integrate smoothly with Arcade loop

Deliverable: Playable game with multiple difficulty levels using rule-based AI
Week 6 – Machine Learning Preparation

Goals: Prepare ML component and datasets

    Learn or review basic ML concepts relevant for Blackjack

    Create game logs / datasets for training (player actions, outcomes)

    Implement Python scripts to generate training data

    Decide on ML framework: scikit-learn (simpler) or PyTorch (RL agent)

Deliverable: Dataset ready for ML training, clear plan for integrating AI
Week 7 – ML Integration

Goals: Add ML-based AI as advanced difficulty

    Train a simple ML model (e.g., supervised or reinforcement learning)

    Integrate trained model into the game loop

    Test ML AI against rule-based AI and human player

    Refine ML AI decisions to avoid bugs or illogical plays

Deliverable: Game with advanced ML difficulty mode
Week 8 – Polishing & Distribution

Goals: Finalize and package the game

    Polish animations, sound, and UI transitions

    Test full game on multiple machines / OS (Windows, Linux)

    Package using PyInstaller (.exe or Linux binary)

    Prepare assets folder, README, and instructions

    Playtest and fix bugs

Deliverable: Fully packaged, polished Blackjack game ready to distribute
   Week 4 – User Interface & Menus

        Goals: Add polish to menus and UX
