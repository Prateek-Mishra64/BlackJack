BlackJack Ideas:

    -Use the on_update() function for anything that is moving.
    -Multiple with delta_time to have the movement smother as it matches the refresh rate.
    -REMEMBER TO USE THE TEXT OBJECT INSTEAD CAUSE ITS FASTER NIGGA!!!

    -For background have multiple sprites moving it can be done so :
        --Have cards sprite moving diagonally upwards in left adn right from their original position and then comming back to their
            original position making a sort of brething animation.



Game Logic:
 
        The dealer on easy level will hit untill he has a hand total of 17 or more, then he will stand everytime.
             On higher levels dealer might hit stand 



Q table Reinforced Learning:
        The difficutlty will be set using the Q table Reinforced Learning where to make higher level difficulty we will Use
            Exploration and will only use exploitation for mid level difficutlty.


            The discount rate defines weather the AI will prioritise the future rewards over the immediate rewards or not.




The things to do in the game:


1. make the escape menu so it gives the option for exiting the game and going back to the main menu.
2. make the ui working with the click to reveal part for the cards dealt to the user. This happens to every card that is dealt.
3. make the cards dealt animation across all the difficulties and make the game code abit more refine.
4. correct the difficulty for the game.
5. IF and ONLY IF have spare time make the coin toss thing on a tie.
