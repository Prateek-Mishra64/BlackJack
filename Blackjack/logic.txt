Use nested arrays to denote the deck of cards
array = [[Diamond][Hearts][Clubs][Spade]]
Generate 2 random number, first to pick the house of cards and second to pick the number.
random = array[i][j]
We draw the sprite of the selected card and draw it either to the dealere or the player.

First two cards are dealed to the dealer and one of the cards is randomly selected and flipped.

Next two cards are dealed to the player and both are fliped according to user selection.

If the sum of the dealer cards is 16 or less, the dealer will always hit otherwise the dealer will stay.

The user will be given the choice to hit or stand. 

After the dealer will either hit or stand according his cards.

Now to decide the winner of the round, we will sum the cards of the dealer and player. Whoever gets the bigger sum / closer to 21 will win.

If the sum of the player or the dealer goes above 21 the other person instantly wins.
